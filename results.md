## Output and Correctness of Each Algorithm
### DFS Output
The DFS traversal works as expected and gives us the nodes in the correct order. We know this as we created a test graph which we knew the correct traveral for and ran our DFS on it, which resulted in the correct output.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm Output
We wrote Dijkstra's Algorithm in order to find the shortest path 

### Kosaraju's Algorithm Output
We wrote Kosarajus's Algorithm to print whether or not the graph we inputed is strongly connected or weakly connected. Using different test graphs, we were able to see that it does in fact work as intended for this purpose.
