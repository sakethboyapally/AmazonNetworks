## StanfordLargeNetwork
Project on Analyzing Amazon Customer data using Graph Algorithms in C++

### Github Organization
All of our test cases are located within the "tests" folder of our repository. The test files we used as well as the actual Amazon data set is located within the "data" folder. Our graph algorithms and parsing code is located within "src". The graph algorithms can be found in "graph.cpp" and our code for parsing the source file can be found in "utils.cpp". The written report is labeled as "results.md" and the presentation video is labeled as "cs225final".

### Running Instructions
In order to run the test cases we have written, we use the same general process as MP testing in CS 225. 1.) cd build 2.) make test 3.) ./test. We can also do make and ./main to see the output from main. The test cases we wrote test the data parsing, the creation of an adjacency list from the raw Amazon data, as well as our two algorithms, Djikstra's and Kosaraju's.
